INTRODUCTION                                        *vim-qf-preview* *qfpreview*

vim-qf-preview is a |ftplugin| for the |quickfix-window| and |location-list-window|
to quickly preview the location of the quickfix error under the cursor in a
|popup-window|.

The popup window is opened directly above the quickfix window, without
rearranging the current window layout. Moving the cursor in any direction
closes the popup window.

==============================================================================
MAPPINGS                                                  *qfpreview-mappings*

Quickfix window ~

<plug>(qf-preview-open)                              *<plug>(qf-preview-open)*
            Preview the file under the cursor at the current quickfix location
            in a popup window. The window will be scrolled such that the
            buffer line with the error is at the top of the popup window.

            Note: To avoid conflicts with other plugins, the key mapping is
            not bound to any key-sequence by default. You will first have to
            bind <plug>(qf-preview-open) to a key of your choice.

            For example, to open the popup window with "p", add the following
            to |qf.vim|, for example, in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/qf.vim: >
                nmap <buffer> p <plug>(qf-preview-open)
<
            Or alternatively, if you prefer keeping your plugin settings in
            your |vimrc|: >
                augroup qfpreview
                  autocmd!
                  autocmd FileType qf nmap <buffer> p <plug>(qf-preview-open)
                augroup END
<
                                                    *qfpreview-popup-mappings*
Popup window mappings ~

While the mouse pointer is on the popup window, mouse scroll events will cause
the text to scroll up or down as one would expect. Clicking on "X" in the top
right corner will close the window.

EXAMPLES                                                  *qfpreview-examples*

1. Override the popup scrolling keys: >
    vim9script
    # Option 1: in your vimrc
    g:qfpreview = {
        scrolldown: 'j',
        scrollup: 'k',
        halfpagedown: 'd',
        halfpageup: 'u',
        fullpagedown: 'f',
        fullpageup: 'b',
        number: v:true,
        offset: 5,
        height: 20
    }

    # Option 2: in ~/.vim/after/ftplugin/qf.vim
    b:qfpreview = {
        scrolldown: "\<C-e>",
        scrollup: "\<C-y>",
        close: "\<Esc>",
        height: 20
    }
<
2. Instead of displaying a cursorline, display a sign in the 'signcolumn': >
    g:qfpreview = {sign: {text: '>>', texthl: 'Search'}}
<
4. Same as 2., but also enable the 'number' column. The placed sign is
   displayed in the 'number' column: >
    g:qfpreview = {
        number: true,
        sign: {text: '>>', texthl: 'Search'}
    }
<
